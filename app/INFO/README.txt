One time scraper is a free open-source python environment intended for
web scraping purposes. The goal of this project is to provide absolutely
free environment with no restrictions regarding internet access (so you
likely can make whatever outgoing HTTP requests) to make it possible providing
online web scraping platform to debug and run your web scrapers.

# WARNING!

Even though you are absolutely free to write whatever code you like even
that one that will kill the server and down virtual machine connected to
my pythonanywhere account I highly don't recommend you doing so due to the
reason that account can get banned so you'll take away the opportunity
to write web scrapers online from those developers who really needs that. I'm
not afraid to lose 5$ spent to buy this subscription, but I really don't want
others to suffer from inappropriate behavior of those who can really harm this
server.
